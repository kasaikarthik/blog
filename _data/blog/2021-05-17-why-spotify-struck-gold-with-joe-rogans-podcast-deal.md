So I long wanted to write about Joe Rogan moving to Spotify and how it would actually depreciate his brand value. This is just mad rant from a fan of the show with a little guestimate game, no influencer stuff (Pretentious people dare I say). 

To start off, I listen to a few podcasts quite loyally, including the topic of interest, The Joe Rogan Podcast. But Spotify isn't equal to RSS or YouTube in terms of reach, at least not now or in the next couple of years. Rogan moving there might be a gamble to take. Even if we take 50% of the claimed 190 Mil downloads coming from loyalists as the best case scenario, still about another 95 Mil users are bypassers. This huge chunk of the audience would be lost. 

Yes, Spotify would introduce new users to Rogan every day and maybe even convert a fraction of them to be loyalists. But that will definitely take some years to achieve break-even in terms But, this might be a big win for Spotify. Let's consider the worst case of only 20% being loyalists. Even if we consider 50% of them already on Spotify (like me) that's a massive **20 Million people straight**. Woah. Considering it's a 100 Mil Dollar+ deal, **they brought those users at a little over 5 dollars/user**. I'll take that any day.
